# Raising Issues/Features

Issues are used to raise features as well as bugs.
When raised, please include as much information as possible.
A maintainer will then review & label the issue and assign it to a release milestone (where applicable).

# Pull Request Location

Please feel free to fork and send pull requests.
Requests should be sent to the master branch & a maintainer will review and merge your requests.

# Coding Standard

All code submitted is expected to be at the same level as the rest of the application.
Code submitted should follow the same sytle also, I currently use resharper and use that to help with code format/style/conventions.

# Releases

Releases are created manually and will be done by a maintainer
